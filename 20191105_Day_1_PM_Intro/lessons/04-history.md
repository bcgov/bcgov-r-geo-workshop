#### Git History

As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`, adding yet another line.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~


~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
~~~


Now, let's see what we get.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
~~~


~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@

~~~


which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` 
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**-d*uh*]) 
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
~~~

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:


~~~
$ git diff HEAD~3 mars.txt
~~~


~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as
well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our 
working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

~~~
$ git show HEAD~3 mars.txt

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
`f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`,
so let's try this:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
~~~


~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
~~~


~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed—now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to
`mars.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
~~~


~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~


We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~


~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~


As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
~~~


~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~


~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~


~~~
$ git status
~~~


~~~
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    modified:   mars.txt

~~~


Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
~~~
